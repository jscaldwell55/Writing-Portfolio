            <h2>Sora, Markov Chain, and AI Angst</h2>
            <p>Part 1</p>
            <p>The release of OpenAI's Sora has generated both excitement and consternation. While the fears are predictable, they raise important questions about the core issues. I asked ChatGPT about these concerns, and its response listed eight main reasons why people fear AI. I'll address each one across three blog posts.</p>

            <p>Loss of Jobs</p>
            <p>"One of the most immediate concerns is the fear that AI and automation will lead to widespread job loss. As AI systems become more capable of performing tasks traditionally done by humans, from manufacturing to even more complex cognitive jobs, there's a worry that humans will be increasingly displaced from the workforce." - ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>While AI automation will likely displace some jobs and roles, as with many emotionally charged issues, confirmation bias often trumps good faith attempts to measure actual causality.</p>
            
            <p>This issue isn't unique to AI. The biggest paradigm shifts in tech have always disrupted the economy and society. Once ubiquitous, the technology becomes invisible. Most people are unaware of how much AI they already use daily, from spam filters to product recommendations.</p>
           
            <p>The most important takeaway is that AI will continue on its current trajectory. To quote the title of a 2023 article in the Harvard Business Review by Karim Lakhani: "AI Won't Replace Humans But Humans With AI Will Replace Humans Without AI".</p>
            
            <p>AI Overlords</p>
            <p>"Popular culture often depicts scenarios where AI becomes too intelligent or self-aware, leading to situations where humans can no longer control or predict AI behavior. This fear is rooted in the concern that AI might one day surpass human intelligence (a concept known as the singularity), potentially leading to outcomes that could harm humanity."- ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>This is what I like to think of as "the Skynet scenario". Recently, Artificial General Intelligence has replaced singularity as the AI that could eventually supplant humankind. Ian Hogwarth's 2023 State of AI Report defines AGI as "God-like AI." But what would this actually mean?</p> 
           
            <p>Cambridge's Dr. Tom McClelland argues we're not in a position to make an informed judgment about conscious AI, since we don't really understand our own human consciousness. The MIT Technology Review echoes this, highlighting the difficulty in determining consciousness.</p>
           
            <p>This definitional challenge recalls Bertrand Russell's "turkey illusion" explaining Hume's problem of induction. It illustrates how AI complements us: while we can't be certain the sun will rise tomorrow based on past sunrises, AI gets us closer. Perhaps seeing AI as addressing pre-existing human needs makes it feel more like natural progress than a threat.</p>
           
            <p>The technology underlying GenAI has existed for decades. The Markov chain (1906) offers a simple example: predicting text by looking at previous words, similar to ChatGPT's basic approach.</p>
           
            <p>MIT professor Tommi Jaakkola notes: "We were generating things way before the last decade, but the major distinction here is in terms of the complexity of objects we can generate and the scale at which we can train these models." The fundamental tech isn't new; the applications are.</p>

            <p>Part 2</p>
            <p>Yesterday we began exploring why AI generates such fear. Having addressed the first two reasons from ChatGPT, let's examine the next four.</p>
           
            <p>Privacy Invasion</p>
            <p>"AI technologies, especially those involving surveillance and data analysis, raise fears about the erosion of privacy. The ability of AI systems to collect, analyze, and act on vast amounts of personal data can lead to unprecedented levels of surveillance and intrusion into private lives." - ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found 81% of Americans worry about how private companies use their data, and 71% about government data use. This concern runs deep.</p>
            
            <p>However, this shouldn't be laid at AI's door. From my five years in AdTech, I saw that while we used ML to optimize real-time bidding, our extensive data collection practices existed independently of AI. They relied on data engineering, not artificial intelligence.</p>
            
            <p>Companies use ML/AI to better target ads to relevant audiences. AI doesn't collect the data; it processes what's already gathered. If anything, it increases the chance you'll see useful ads.</p>
            
            <p>The government aspect is murkier. Without media expos√©s, leaked documents, or whistleblowers, we often learn about domestic intelligence practices long after implementation. As for how the government uses AI for data collection? Likely however they choose.</p>

            <p>Bias and Discrimination</p>
            <p>"AI systems can inherit biases from their human creators or from biased data sets they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and loan approval, perpetuating and even amplifying existing inequalities." - ChatGPT</p>
           
            <p>This is a legitimate fear. Data inherently reflects systematic bias unless actively mitigated. Healthcare offers disturbing examples where AI has created disparities in care. For deeper analysis of solutions, see the paper by fairness in machine learning expert Dr. Na Zou.</p>
           
            <p>Weaponization</p>
            <p>"The potential military applications of AI, including autonomous weapons systems that can select and engage targets without human intervention, raise fears of a new arms race and the possibility of AI being used in warfare with catastrophic consequences." -ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>I find this somewhat bemusing. Nuclear weapons pose a non-speculative threat, yet we've coexisted with them for 70 years. This isn't to minimize nuclear risk, but to note that existential threats aren't new. Even cyber attacks on aging power grids pose immediate dangers. Here, at least, AI serves as a defensive tool in cybersecurity.</p>
            
            <p>Existential Risk</p>
            <p>"Some theorists and technologists fear that a superintelligent AI could pose an existential risk to humanity if its goals misalign with human values. This scenario envisions AI viewing humans as either threats, irrelevant, or resources to be optimized." -ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>As noted in Part 1, science too often gets conflated with futurism in these discussions. Though occasionally futurists get it right (see my literary hero William Gibson).</p>
            
            <p>Part 3</p>
            <p>Let's conclude our examination of primary AI fears with the final two concerns.</p>
            
            <p>Dehumanization and Ethical Concerns</p>
            <p>"There's concern that widespread AI use in elderly care, education, or companionship could dehumanize society. People worry that replacing human interactions with AI might erode social bonds and ethical values." -ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>As someone working at a company facilitating human-AI voice interaction, I'll address this head-on. AI's morality lies in application, not existence. We're excited about AI because it helps humans accomplish tasks. If potential abuse prevented technological advancement, we'd never progress.</p>
            
            <p>These concerns ultimately rest with humans. Elder care and education have always been societal responsibilities. While EdTech shows promising benefits, how we implement it remains our choice.</p>
            
            <p>Applying human ethics to AI resembles attributing human emotions to animals. Working at a Texas ranch, I've learned that horses, while beloved companions, are powerful creatures with hardwired instincts. A spooked horse that injures its rider feels no guilt. Similarly, AI isn't party to human ethics - the ethical implications lie in how we apply it.</p>
            
            <p>Economic and Social Disruption</p>
            <p>"Beyond job loss, AI may cause broad economic and social disruptions. The fear is that AI's benefits will be unevenly distributed, widening societal divides between those controlling and those affected by the technology." - ChatGPT</p>
            
            <p>Again, these fears reflect concerns about human behavior rather than AI itself. While wealth and power disparities merit attention, they're historical constants. The potential for misuse by bad actors isn't unique to AI.</p>
            
            <p>In closing, we should remain mindful of legitimate AI concerns. But like any human invention, the crucial questions center not on the technology itself, but on its application.</p>

            <h2>Improving AI for Atypical Voices is a Win for All of Us</h2>
            <p>Working in AI, I'm inspired by its potential impact on individual lives. A recent Wall Street Journal "Future of Everything" podcast explored how AI voice assistants can help people with atypical voices better use devices like Siri and Alexa. The core question: "What will it take to create voice assistants that work for everyone right out of the box?"</p>

            <p>Engaging with the World</p>
            <p>Michael Cash, 49, lives with cerebral palsy. While comfortable communicating with friends and family, it took years of speech therapy to build confidence with strangers.</p>
            
            <p>He faces ongoing challenges with voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. While Google claims under 10% error rates for automatic speech recognition, people with neurologic conditions often encounter 50-90% error rates.</p>
            
            <p>Evolving Methodology</p>
            <p>Mark Hasegawa from the University of Illinois notes that commercially viable end-to-end neural network speech recognition emerged only in 2014. This breakthrough enabled predicting upcoming speech sounds based on previous ones, aided by Johns Hopkins' Librispeech database of audiobook recordings.</p>
            
            <p>Yet even with advanced datasets and neural networks, these systems struggle with atypical voices ‚Äì much like humans do. This has driven companies to seek innovative solutions for universal accessibility.</p>
            
            <p>New Approaches</p>
            <p>Cash now works at Voiceitt, which released Voiceitt2 in August 2023. This tool lets users train their voice assistant, enabling features from transcription to ChatGPT interaction. Most significantly, it creates real-time transcripts for workplace software like Webex. As Voiceitt co-founder Sara Smolley puts it, "What a ramp was to an office building, Voiceitt is to today's remote workplace."</p>
             
            <p>Voice AI That's More Accessible for Everyone</p>
            <p>Google, Amazon, and Voiceitt agree: improving accessibility enhances functionality for all users. Beyond universal benefits, this work is crucial for the estimated 1 billion people (15% of the global population) living with disabilities. A 2020 NIH paper notes:</p>
            
            <p>"People with motor and cognitive impairments could significantly benefit from remotely controlling home appliances and personal devices. Voice assistants can help individuals with disabilities manage their homes independently."</p>
            
            <p>This represents a call to action for advancing accessibility. At Vapi, our ML work on conversational intelligence continues improving speech recognition across 70+ languages. Despite skeptics, AI's positive impact on lives grows daily.</p>
